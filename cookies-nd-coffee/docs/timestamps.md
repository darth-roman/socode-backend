# Timestamps Docs

This is a normal `Schema`
```js
import { Schema, model } from "mongoose";

const juiceSchema = new Schema({
    name:{
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    price: {
        type: Number,
        required: true
    },
    fruits: {
        type: [String],
        required: true
    },
})

const Juice = model("Juice", juiceSchema)

export default Juice 
```
We would want to add something to track `createdAt` time and `updatedAt` time
instead of doing it manually, we can add `timestamps` as a second argument on `Schema`

```js
import { Schema, model } from "mongoose";

// The options object we add as a second argument

const options = {
    timestamps: true
}

const juiceSchema = new Schema({
    name:{
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    price: {
        type: Number,
        required: true
    },
    fruits: {
        type: [String],
        required: true
    },
},
    options
)

const Juice = model("Juice", juiceSchema)

export default Juice 
```

When we run it, we will have this as a result, when we add a new `Juice` document

After we make a `POST` request to add a new resource `Juice`

![Request and Response](media/Screenshot%20from%202025-08-07%2013-02-28.png)

We get a `201 Created` response which means our resource has been added successfully

If u could notice, there are two **EXTRA** properties in the returned document `createdAt` and `updatedAt`

These are the `timestamps` we want, they are automatically generated by mongoose

and even we find it in our newly added document in our database
